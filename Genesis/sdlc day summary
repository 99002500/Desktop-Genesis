Take beverage vending machine
Day 1: V Model
1. Define product

2. Research
Aging and costing

Machine 5 years ago, today now.

Coffee machine from different groups.

3. Features of product

4. SWOT analysis

5. Requirements:
High level- Feature- Machine is able to dispense beverage of choice
Low level- Different types of coffee
Consistency, taste, working parameters- 230v 
Grinder to grind coffee beans and heating filament
Requirement ID and description

-> Visit coffee machines of all groups and compare the products

6. System Designs

Draw UML diagrams- Structural and behaviour (2 at high level and 2 at low level)
UML diagram at system level- Do for system level

Like system level component diagram

7. 2 Test plans (Integration level test plan(High level) Unit level test plan(Low level))
 Test ID, test description, expected i/p and expected o/p, actual o/p, actual i/p.
 
 Tracebility
 
 Integration level test plan- Multiple times button is pressed what happens
 
 Seperate pipe to dispense coffee, milk so that coffee taste doesnt come to milk
 
 Requirement based testing
 Scenario based testing- Reacting based on user inputs, power cut what to do
 Boundary based testing
 
 
 Team activities
 Impact of defective products
 Why UML and SysML
 
 UML and SysML- Powerful visual representation
 
 Summary:
 

 
 Why SDLC and then defects and recalls that happens in real life
 
 Why go through processes- SDLC

Types of projects and requirements and technological changes
